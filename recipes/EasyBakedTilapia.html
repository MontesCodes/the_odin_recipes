      <h1>Cooking Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Lightly grease a
          9x13-inch baking dish.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>
          Place tilapia fillets in the bottom of the baking dish and season with
          seafood seasoning. Melt butter with garlic in a small bowl in the
          microwave, about 30 seconds on medium; pour over fish. Top each fillet
          with a slice or two of lemon. Arrange the frozen mixed vegetables
          around the fish, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the
          dish with aluminum foil.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and fish flakes
          easily with a fork, 25 to 30 minutes.
